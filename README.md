# PIR_CARREIRA_RUFATO_Raul

This repository presents my PIR which is Deep Learning in Aeroelasticity, in which I developed the work "Avoid aeroelasticity instabilities with a morphing airfoil using neural networks".

Here it can be seen the bibliography that I used, my final presentation and all the codes I have developed and those I have used from other people.
